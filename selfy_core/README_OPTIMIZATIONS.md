# Selfy Core Optimizations

This document describes the optimizations made to the Selfy Core codebase to improve performance and reduce unnecessary LLM calls.

## 1. Request Analyzer Optimizations

### 1.1 Skip Final Analysis for High Confidence Results

The request analyzer now skips the final analysis step when the preprocessing result has a high confidence score. This reduces the number of LLM calls for simple queries.

- Added a new configuration parameter: `context_engine.request_analyzer.skip_final_analysis_threshold` (default: 0.9)
- When preprocessing confidence is above this threshold, the final analysis is skipped
- The preprocessing result is used directly, including any potential answer

### 1.2 Potential Answer in Preprocessing

The preprocessing prompt now includes a request for a potential answer for simple factual queries. This allows the system to respond to simple queries without additional LLM calls.

- Added a `potential_answer` field to the preprocessing result
- The potential answer is included in the analysis result when available
- The execution planner can use this potential answer directly for high-confidence queries

## 2. Context Builder and Execution Planner Optimizations

### 2.1 Context Builder Handling of Potential Answers

The context builder now checks for potential answers in the analysis result and creates a special context when available with high confidence.

- Added a check for `potential_answer` in the analysis result in the `build_context` method
- When a potential answer is available with confidence >= 0.9, a special context is created
- Added a new `_build_potential_answer_context` method to create a context that includes the potential answer
- This ensures the potential answer is properly passed to the execution planner

### 2.2 Direct Use of Potential Answers

The execution planner now checks for potential answers in the analysis result and uses them directly when available with high confidence.

- Added a check for `potential_answer` in the analysis result in the `_generate_final_response` method
- When a potential answer is available with confidence >= 0.9, it's used directly
- This bypasses the need for additional LLM calls for simple queries

## 3. Ollama Provider Optimizations

### 3.1 Removed max_tokens Warning

The Ollama provider no longer logs a warning when the max_tokens parameter is provided. This reduces log noise.

- Removed the warning message in the `generate_text` method
- Updated the options handling to skip the max_tokens parameter

## 4. Identity Filter and Output Validator Consolidation

### 4.1 Combined Components

The identity filter and output validator have been combined into a single component to reduce redundant processing and improve performance.

- Added output validation functionality to the identity filter
- Added safety patterns and validation configuration to the identity filter
- Modified the `filter_output` method to perform both identity filtering and output validation
- Added `validate` and `sanitize` methods from the output validator

### 4.2 Streamlined Output Processing

The combined component provides a more streamlined output processing flow:

1. Apply identity filtering (pattern replacements and LLM checks)
2. Validate the filtered output for quality and safety
3. Apply sanitization if validation fails but sanitization is possible
4. Return the appropriate result based on the filtering and validation outcome

## Configuration

The following configuration parameters can be adjusted to fine-tune the optimizations:

```
context_engine.request_analyzer.confidence_threshold = 0.7
context_engine.request_analyzer.skip_final_analysis_threshold = 0.9
identity.filter.enable_llm_checks = false
identity.filter.output.replacement_enabled = true
pipeline.output_handling.validation.enable_sanitization = true
pipeline.output_handling.validation.min_length = 1
pipeline.output_handling.validation.max_length = 8192
```

## Performance Impact

These optimizations are expected to:

1. Reduce the number of LLM calls for simple queries
2. Improve response time for high-confidence queries
3. Reduce redundant processing in the output handling pipeline
4. Maintain or improve output quality and identity consistency
