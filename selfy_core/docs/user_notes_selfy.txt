the last agent says about launching
C:\Users\rob\Documents\augment-projects\selfy\aider
python -m aider.main
This launches Aider using the Python module syntax, which ensures that Python can properly resolve all the module imports. The command was executed from the aider directory, which contains the aider package.
This worked for it Can you try this ?

Then later 
If you want to launch it with specific parameters, you could add them to the command. For example:
python -m aider.main --repo-dir C:\Users\rob\Documents\augment-projects\selfy\selfy_core --vector-enabled --vector-use-gpu --memory-max-usage-mb 2048
This would launch Aider with the selfy_core directory as the repository, enable the vector database with GPU acceleration, and set the maximum memory usage to 2048 MB.
