Execution and Planning System Documentation
System Overview
The Execution and Planning System is a sophisticated component responsible for planning, managing, and executing tasks within the Selfy agent. It consists of three main components that work together to handle the complete lifecycle of task execution:
Execution Planner
Implementation Planner
Implementation Executor
Architecture
Core Components
1. Execution Planner (execution_planner.py)
Purpose: High-level task planning and orchestration
Key Responsibilities:
Generates execution plans for user requests
Manages tool selection and sequencing
Handles error recovery and fallbacks
Coordinates parallel execution when possible
2. Implementation Planner (implementation_planner.py)
Purpose: Detailed planning for system improvements
Key Responsibilities:
Creates structured implementation plans
Manages step dependencies
Tracks progress and status
Handles approval workflows
3. Implementation Executor (implementation_executor.py)
Purpose: Executes implementation plans
Key Responsibilities:
Executes individual implementation steps
Tracks execution results
Manages execution state
Handles errors and rollbacks
