Reflection and Reasoning System Documentation
System Overview
The Reflection and Reasoning System is a sophisticated component that enables the agent to reflect on its experiences, reason about improvements, and make informed decisions. It combines enhanced reflection capabilities with advanced reasoning mechanisms to drive continuous improvement.
Architecture
