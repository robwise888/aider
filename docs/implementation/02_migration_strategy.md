# Migration Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for migrating from the original Context Engine to the Context Engine V2. It describes the approach, phases, and considerations for a smooth migration.

## Migration Approach

The migration from the original Context Engine to the Context Engine V2 will follow an adapter-based approach:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: Implement an adapter that allows the new Context Engine to be used with the existing system
2. **Parallel Operation**: Run the original and new Context Engines in parallel during the migration
3. **Gradual Transition**: Gradually transition from the original to the new Context Engine
4. **Feature Parity**: Ensure that the new Context Engine has feature parity with the original
5. **Performance Verification**: Verify that the new Context Engine meets or exceeds the performance of the original

## Migration Phases

The migration will be divided into the following phases:

1. **Phase 1: Adapter Implementation**
   - Implement the `ContextEngineAdapter` class
   - Implement the interface with the original Context Engine
   - Implement the interface with the new Context Engine

2. **Phase 2: Parallel Operation**
   - Run the original and new Context Engines in parallel
   - Compare the results of the two engines
   - Identify and fix discrepancies

3. **Phase 3: Gradual Transition**
   - Gradually increase the percentage of requests handled by the new Context Engine
   - Monitor the performance and accuracy of the new Context Engine
   - Address any issues that arise

4. **Phase 4: Complete Transition**
   - Transition all requests to the new Context Engine
   - Remove the original Context Engine
   - Remove the adapter

## Adapter Implementation

The `ContextEngineAdapter` class will adapt the new Context Engine to the interface of the original Context Engine:

```python
class ContextEngineAdapter:
    """
    Adapter for the old context engine.
    """

    def __init__(self, llm_wrapper=None, capability_manifest=None, cache_size=None):
        """
        Initialize the context engine adapter.
        
        Args:
            llm_wrapper: The LLM wrapper to use
            capability_manifest: The capability manifest to use
            cache_size: The size of the response cache
        """
        # Initialize cache
        self._cache = {}
        self._cache_size = cache_size
        self._cache_hits = 0
        self._cache_misses = 0
        self._request_count = 0

        # Create mock objects for the old engine's dependencies
        self.ollama_wrapper = MockOldOllamaWrapper()
        self.groq_wrapper = MockOldGroqWrapper()
        self.capability_registry = MockOldCapabilityRegistry()
        self.tool_manager = MockToolManager()
        self.llm_manager = LLMManager(tool_manager=self.tool_manager)

        # Create the old context engine components
        self.request_analyzer = RequestAnalyzer(
            llm_manager=self.llm_manager,
            capability_registry=self.capability_registry
        )
        self.context_builder = ContextBuilder(
            capability_registry=self.capability_registry
        )
        self.execution_planner = ExecutionPlanner(
            tool_manager=self.tool_manager,
            llm_manager=self.llm_manager
        )
        self.context_engine = ContextEngine(
            llm_manager=self.llm_manager,
            tool_manager=self.tool_manager,
            capability_manifest_path=self.capability_manifest_path
        )

    def process(self, processed_input):
        """
        Process a user request.
        
        Args:
            processed_input: The processed input from the input handler
            
        Returns:
            A ContextEngineResult object
        """
        # Extract data from ProcessedInput
        user_input = processed_input.validated_input
        conversation_history = processed_input.conversation_history
        metadata = processed_input.input_metadata

        # Check cache for identical request
        cache_key = self._generate_cache_key(user_input, conversation_history)
        if cache_key in self._cache:
            return self._cache[cache_key]

        # Format data for the old engine
        old_engine_input = self._translate_input_to_old_format(user_input, conversation_history, metadata)

        # Process the request with the old engine
        old_engine_result = self.context_engine.process_request(
            user_input=old_engine_input["user_input"]
        )

        # Translate the old engine result to the new format
        result = self._translate_result_to_new_format(old_engine_result)

        # Cache the result
        self._update_cache(cache_key, result)

        return result
```

## Parallel Operation

During the parallel operation phase, both the original and new Context Engines will process the same requests:

```python
def process_request(user_input, conversation_history=None, metadata=None):
    """
    Process a user request.
    
    Args:
        user_input: The user's input
        conversation_history: The conversation history
        metadata: Additional metadata
        
    Returns:
        The result of processing the request
    """
    # Create ProcessedInput
    processed_input = ProcessedInput(
        validated_input=user_input,
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        metadata=metadata
    )
    
    # Process with original Context Engine
    original_result = original_context_engine.process(processed_input)
    
    # Process with new Context Engine
    new_result = new_context_engine.process(processed_input)
    
    # Compare results
    compare_results(original_result, new_result)
    
    # Return original result during parallel operation
    return original_result
```

## Gradual Transition

During the gradual transition phase, the percentage of requests handled by the new Context Engine will be gradually increased:

```python
def process_request(user_input, conversation_history=None, metadata=None):
    """
    Process a user request.
    
    Args:
        user_input: The user's input
        conversation_history: The conversation history
        metadata: Additional metadata
        
    Returns:
        The result of processing the request
    """
    # Create ProcessedInput
    processed_input = ProcessedInput(
        validated_input=user_input,
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        metadata=metadata
    )
    
    # Determine which engine to use
    use_new_engine = random.random() < new_engine_percentage
    
    if use_new_engine:
        # Process with new Context Engine
        result = new_context_engine.process(processed_input)
    else:
        # Process with original Context Engine
        result = original_context_engine.process(processed_input)
    
    # Track which engine was used
    track_engine_usage(use_new_engine)
    
    return result
```

## Complete Transition

During the complete transition phase, all requests will be handled by the new Context Engine:

```python
def process_request(user_input, conversation_history=None, metadata=None):
    """
    Process a user request.
    
    Args:
        user_input: The user's input
        conversation_history: The conversation history
        metadata: Additional metadata
        
    Returns:
        The result of processing the request
    """
    # Create ProcessedInput
    processed_input = ProcessedInput(
        validated_input=user_input,
        conversation_history=conversation_history,
        metadata=metadata
    )
    
    # Process with new Context Engine
    result = new_context_engine.process(processed_input)
    
    return result
```

## Feature Parity

To ensure feature parity between the original and new Context Engines, the following features will be implemented in the new Context Engine:

1. **Request Analysis**: The ability to analyze user requests and determine the intent, entities, and required capabilities
2. **Capability Matching**: The ability to match required capabilities to available capabilities
3. **Execution Planning**: The ability to create and execute plans to fulfill user requests
4. **Error Handling**: The ability to handle errors gracefully and provide user-friendly error messages
5. **Memory Integration**: The ability to store and retrieve information from memory
6. **Identity Filtering**: The ability to filter responses to ensure they align with the agent's identity

## Performance Verification

To verify that the new Context Engine meets or exceeds the performance of the original, the following metrics will be tracked:

1. **Response Time**: The time it takes to process a request
2. **Accuracy**: The accuracy of the response
3. **Error Rate**: The rate of errors
4. **Resource Usage**: The CPU, memory, and network usage
5. **Scalability**: The ability to handle increased load

## Migration Considerations

The following considerations will be taken into account during the migration:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: The new Context Engine should be backward compatible with the existing system
2. **Data Migration**: Any data used by the original Context Engine should be migrated to the new Context Engine
3. **Configuration Migration**: Any configuration used by the original Context Engine should be migrated to the new Context Engine
4. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Monitoring and alerting should be in place to detect any issues during the migration
5. **Rollback Plan**: A rollback plan should be in place in case the migration needs to be reversed

## Migration Timeline

The migration is expected to take 4 weeks:

- **Week 1**: Phase 1 - Adapter Implementation
- **Week 2**: Phase 2 - Parallel Operation
- **Week 3**: Phase 3 - Gradual Transition
- **Week 4**: Phase 4 - Complete Transition

## Migration Risks and Mitigation

The migration has the following risks:

1. **Feature Parity Issues**: The new Context Engine may not have feature parity with the original.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive tests to verify feature parity, and have a rollback plan.

2. **Performance Issues**: The new Context Engine may not meet performance requirements.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement performance tests early, optimize critical paths, and have a rollback plan.

3. **Integration Issues**: The new Context Engine may not integrate well with the existing system.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive integration tests, and have a rollback plan.

4. **Data Migration Issues**: The data migration may not be successful.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive data migration tests, and have a rollback plan.

5. **User Impact**: The migration may impact users.
   - **Mitigation**: Implement the migration during low-usage periods, and have a rollback plan.

## Migration Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful if:

1. The new Context Engine has feature parity with the original
2. The new Context Engine meets or exceeds the performance of the original
3. The new Context Engine integrates well with the existing system
4. The data migration is successful
5. The migration has minimal impact on users
