Notes
The LLM Integration system provides sophisticated language model integration but would benefit from architectural improvements and better organization. Key focus areas should be improving error handling, response validation, and memory management while maintaining existing functionality.
Would you like me to:
Dive deeper into any specific component?
Create documentation for another subsystem?
Provide more detailed recommendations for any area?
Analyze specific code sections in more detail?
